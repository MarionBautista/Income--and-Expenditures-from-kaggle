Understanding Regional Income Disparity ðŸ’°
This project visualizes the stark difference in average monthly income across the Philippines. The data clearly shows that the country's economic power is highly concentrated, with the National Capital Region (NCR) leading the way.

Quick Look: Key Findings âœ¨
The Top Earners: The chart confirms that the National Capital Region (NCR) and nearby regions like CALABARZON (Region IV-A) and Central Luzon (Region III) have the highest average monthly incomes. This is no surprise, given the concentration of businesses and job opportunities in these areas.

The National Benchmark: A dashed line across the chart marks the national average monthly income. Notice that only a handful of regionsâ€”NCR, CALABARZON, and Central Luzonâ€”are above this line.

The Lowest Incomes: On the other end of the spectrum, regions in the Visayas and Mindanao, specifically the Bicol Region (Region V), SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII), and BARMM, show the lowest average incomes. This highlights the ongoing challenge of uneven economic development across the Philippines.
