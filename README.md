ðŸ“Š Philippines Income & Expenditure Data Analysis


Understanding Regional Income Disparity ðŸ’°
This project visualizes the stark difference in average monthly income across the Philippines. The data clearly shows that the country's economic power is highly concentrated, with the National Capital Region (NCR) leading the way.

Quick Look: Key Findings âœ¨
The Top Earners: The chart confirms that the National Capital Region (NCR) and nearby regions like CALABARZON (Region IV-A) and Central Luzon (Region III) have the highest average monthly incomes. This is no surprise, given the concentration of businesses and job opportunities in these areas.

The National Benchmark: A dashed line across the chart marks the national average monthly income. Notice that only a handful of regionsâ€”NCR, CALABARZON, and Central Luzonâ€”are above this line.

The Lowest Incomes: On the other end of the spectrum, regions in the Visayas and Mindanao, specifically the Bicol Region (Region V), SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII), and BARMM, show the lowest average incomes. This highlights the ongoing challenge of uneven economic development across the Philippines.

Understanding Family Expenditures ðŸ›’
The histogram and KDE plot illustrate the distribution of average family expenditures in the Philippines. This visualization helps us understand how spending is spread across different income levels.

Histogram: The bars show the frequency (count) of families within specific spending ranges. You can see that the majority of families have a monthly expenditure in the lower-to-middle range.

Kernel Density Estimate (KDE): The smooth blue line is a KDE plot, which provides a smoothed-out version of the histogram. It highlights the overall shape of the distribution, making the most common expenditure values more apparent.

Key Findings ðŸ“Š
Positive Skew: The distribution is positively skewed, meaning the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side. This indicates that while most families have lower expenditures, there's a smaller number of families with significantly higher spending. This is typical of income and expenditure data, where a small percentage of the population accounts for a large portion of total spending.

Central Tendency: The peak of the distribution is centered around PHP 20,000 to PHP 30,000, which represents the most common range of average monthly expenditure among families. This corresponds to the highest bar in the histogram and the peak of the KDE curve.

Outliers/High Spenders: The long tail on the right side of the plot (above PHP 50,000) represents a smaller group of families with very high monthly expenditures.
