### **Key Findings & Regional Highlights** âœ¨

* **Dominant Economic Hubs:** The chart visually confirms that the **National Capital Region (NCR)** and its neighboring regions, such as **CALABARZON (Region IV-A)** and **Central Luzon (Region III)**, have the highest average monthly incomes. This is likely due to the concentration of businesses, industries, and job opportunities in and around the capital.
    
* **National Average:** The dashed line across the chart represents the **national average monthly income**. This serves as a benchmark, showing that only a few regionsâ€”specifically NCR, CALABARZON, and Central Luzonâ€”exceed this national average.
* **Lower-Income Regions:** Conversely, regions in the Visayas and Mindanao, particularly the **Bicol Region (Region V)**, **SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII)**, and the **Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)**, have the lowest average incomes. This disparity underscores the economic challenges and uneven development across the archipelago.

This analysis shows how income is not evenly distributed throughout the Philippines, with significant economic activity and higher earnings concentrated in the most urbanized areas.
